# Arduino Nano Multi-tone Audio Board

This is a carrier board for four Arduino Nanos providing either PWM output or up to three tone() outputs to connected loudspeakers.  It includes a configurable MIDI IN serial connection, but not a complete MIDI IN circuit.  It is designed to be driven directly from the TX pin of another microcontroller.

Bill of Materials:
- Nano Multi-tone PCB.
- 1x 100nF ceramic capacitor.
- 1x 100uF electrolytic capacitor.
- 1x 2.1mm barrel jack socket (PCB mount – see photo).
- 8x 15-way pin header sockets.
- 8x jumpers.
- pin headers.

For tone speaker output:
- 12x 220R resistors.

For PWM output:
- 4x 75R resistors.
- 4x 270R resistors.
- 4x 10K resistors.
- 4x 68nF ceramic capacitors.
- 4x 10uF electrolytic or non-polar capacitors.
- 1x 3.5mm stereo TRS jack socket (PCB mount – see photo).

Errata:
- None.  But note that the power connection requires a centre-negative PSU.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
