- 3x 100nF ceramic capacitors.
- Optional: 2x 16-pin DIP chip sockets,
- 1x 28-pin, wide DIP, ZIF socket.
- pin headers and jumpers.
- Arduino headers.

Errata:
- One of the traces passes too close to one of the mounting holes and must be cut and reconnected.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
