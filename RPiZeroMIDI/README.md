# Raspberry Pi Zero MIDI Module

This is a MIDI module for the Raspberry Pi Zero, although it could be used pretty much with any Raspberry Pi format board with 3V3 voltage levels and a Raspberry Pi GPIO interface.

Bill of Materials:
- Raspberry Pi Zero MIDI PCB.
- 1x H11L1.
- 1x 74HCT14.
- 5x 220R resistors.
- 1x 470R resistors.
- 2x 100nF ceramic capacitors.
- 1x 2x20 way extended GPIO header socket.
- Optional 6-pin and 14-pin DIP sockets.

Errata:
-  There is a missing link between pins 2 and 3 of the 74HCT14, requiring a wire or solder bridge.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
