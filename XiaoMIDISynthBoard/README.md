Bill of Materials:
- XIAO MIDI Synth Board PCB.
- 1x H11L1 optoisolator.
- 1x 1N914 or 1N4148 diode or similar.
- Resistors: 1 each of 10R, 33R, 220R, 470R.
- 8x 10k linear PCM mount potentiometers (see photos for footprint).
- 1x 100nF ceramic capacitor.
- 4x 7-way header sockets.  Ideally “short profile” with plastic height of 5mm, see photo below.
- 1x 2×2 “spring loaded pogo-pin” header.  Ideally the “A height” (i.e. from the bottom of plastic base to the top of spring-loaded contact) is 10mm.  See photo below.
- 1x 2-pin tactile switch, see photo below.
- 2x 180 degree DIN sockets OR 2x TRS stereo PCB mount sockets (see photos for footprints).
- 3x 3-way pin header.
- 2x jumpers
- Optional: 1x 2-way pin header.
- Optional: 6-way DIP socket.

Errata:
- Polarity of the electrolytic capacitor is the wrong way round.
- Silkscreen labels for A0-A4 are missing.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
