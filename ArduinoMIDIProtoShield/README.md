Bill of Materials:
- Arduino MIDI Proto Shield PCB.
- 1x 6N138 optoisolator.
- 4x 220R resistor.
- 1x 4K7 resistor.
- 1x 1N914 or 1N4148 diode.
- 1x 100nF ceramic capacitor.
- 2x 5-pin DIN – pcb mounted (see PCB and photos for footprint).
-- OR 2x TRS stereo jack sockets - pcb mounted - V2 only.
- Optional: 1x 8-pin DIP chip socket.
- 2x 2-way header pins.
- 2x Jumpers.
-- OR 1x DPDT PCB mounted switch (V2/3 only).
- Arduino headers: pins or sockets, but note that extended headers will be required for a "USB B socket" Uno.
- Optional: Additional Arduino headers (V3 only) for IO pin breakouts.

Errata:
- None.

Versions:
* V1: MIDI DIN sockets only.
* V2: MIDI DIN or Type A TRS sockets; optional MIDI disable switch.
* V3: As V2 with additional IO breakout pads either side of the Arduino headers.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
