# Raspberry Pi Zero MiniDexed IO Module

This is an IO module for MiniDexed running on a Raspberry Pi that is particularly suited to a Pi Zero.  It provides a small SSD1306 128x32 OLED display, optional GY-PCM5102 module DAC, and a rotary encoder and buttons as an interface.

Bill of Materials:
- Raspberry Pi Zero MiniDexed IO Module PCB.
- Raspberry Pi Zero.
- 1x SSD1306 128x32 OLED I2C display (pinout GND-5V-SCL-SDA).
- Optional: 1x GY-PCM5102 DAC module.
- 2x 100nF ceramic capacitors.
- 5x 10nF ceramic capacitors.
- 1x Switched rotary encoder (see PCB and photos for footprint).
- 2x "button" push switches (see PCB and photos for footprint).
- 1x 2x20 way extended GPIO header socket.
- 1x 4-way header socket.

Errata:
- The PCB shows "5x 10pF" capacitors, but they should be 5x 10nF.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
