# Raspberry Pi Zynthian Front Panel

This is a design for a PCB-based front panel for my Zynthian IO board.

- Original Design notes: https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2022/10/23/cd-rack-format-zynthian/
- Panel build notes: https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2024/03/17/cd-rack-format-zynthian-part-2/

Bill of Materials (for the Panel, not a complete Zynthian):
- Zynthian IO board build as described in the above posts.
- Zynthian IO Panel PCB.

Errata:
- The MIDI IN TRS socket is connected to GND along with all other sockets.  This is not following the MIDI spec as MIDI IN should not be connected to GND.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
