# Touch Keyboard PCB

This is a design for a pcb "touch" keyboard. There are two variants, one with a silkscreen cover and one with bare pads.  The former designed for capacitive touch applications and the latter for either capacitive touch or a stylus.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
