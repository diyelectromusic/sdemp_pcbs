#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
