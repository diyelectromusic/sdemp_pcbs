Bill of Materials:
- Nano Mozzi Experimenter Shield PCB.
- 1x 6N138 optoisolator.
- 4x 220R resistor.
- 1x 4K7 resistor.
- 1x 270R resistor
- 1x 75R resistor
- 6x 10k linear (B) potentiometer (see photos and footprint)
- 1x 1N914 or 1N4148 diode.
- 2x 100nF ceramic capacitor.
- 1x 68nF ceramic capacitor
- 1x 10uF electrolytic or non-polar capacitor
- 1x 100uF electrolytic capacitor
- 2x 5-pin DIN – pcb mounted (see PCB and photos for footprint).
- Optional: 1x 8-pin DIP chip socket.
- 3x 3-way header pins.
- 3x Jumpers.
- Optional: PCB mounted DPDT switch could replace two sets of jumpers
- 1x 3.5mm stereo TRS audio jack socket, PCB mounted (see photos and footprint)
- Optional: 2x 15-way pin socket headers for the Arduino Nano

Errata:
- The pots are wired "back to front" so zero is fully clockwise and full is fully anti-clockwise.
- The barrel jack is centre-NEGATIVE.
- The Arduino Nano should be placed mini-USB socket down (see photos).

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
