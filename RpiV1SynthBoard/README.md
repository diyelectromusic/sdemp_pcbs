# Raspberry Pi V1 Model B Synth IO Board

This is a design for an IO board PCB for a Raspberry Pi V1 Model B - the one with the 26-way GPIO header and additional P5 IO header.  It provides serial MIDI IN and OUT, a PCM5102 DAC and up to eight analog inputs via an MCP3008.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
