Bill of Materials:
- Square Wave Oscillator PCB.
- 555 timer.
- Optional: 8-pin DIP socket.
- 100R resistor
- 100K resistor.
- 1K trim potentiometer.
- 100nF ceramic capacitor.
- 10nF ceramic capacitor.
- 4.5uF electrolytic capacitor.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
