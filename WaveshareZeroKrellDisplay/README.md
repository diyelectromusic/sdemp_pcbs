Bill of Materials:
- Forbidden Planet “Krell” Display PCB
- Waveshare Zero format board
- 10x APA-106 through-hole programmable RGB LEDs pinout: IN-VCC-GND-OUT.
- 1x 500uF electrolytic capacitor (or thereabouts).
- 1x 47uF electrolytic capacitor.
- Optional: 2x 9-way header sockets (full or low-profile – see notes).
- Pin headers

For the MIDI circuit:
- 1x H11L1 optoisolator.
- 1x 1N4148 or 1N914 signal diode.
- Resistors: 1×10R, 1×33R, 1×220R, 1×470R.
- 1x 100nF ceramic capacitor.
- 2x 3.5mm stereo TRS sockets – pcb mount (see photo and PCB for footprint).
- Optional: 1x 6-way DIP socket.

For potentiometer circuit:
- 1 or 2 x 10K pcb-mount potentiometer (see photo and PCB for footprint).
- 1 or 2x 100nF ceramic capactiors.

For the CV input:
- 1x Thonkiconn style mono PCB mount jack socket.
- Resistors: 1x22K, 1x33K.
- 2x BAT43 Schottky diodes.

Errata:
- Footprint for the Waveshare board is 2.54mm too wide (see notes).

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
