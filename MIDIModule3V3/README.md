Bill of Materials:
- MIDI Module 3V3 PCB.
- 1x H11L1 optoisolator.
- 1x 220R resistor.
- 1x 470R resistor.
- 1x 10R resistor.
- 1x 33R resistor.
- 1x 1N914 or 1N4148 diode.
- 1x 100nF ceramic capacitor.
- 2x 5-pin DIN – pcb mounted (see PCB and photos for footprint).
- Optional: 1x 6-pin DIP chip socket.
- 1x 4-way header pins.

Errata:
- The schematic and PCB show a 100uF capacitor when it should be 100nF.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
