Bill of Materials:
- AY-3-8910 Experimenter PCB.
- Arduino Nano
- Up to 4x AY-3-8910 40-pin DIP devices
- 1x 6N138 optoisolator
- 1x 1N4148 or 1N914 signal diode
- Resistors: 4x 220R, 1x 4K7, 14x 1K
- 6x 100nF ceramic capacitors
- 2x 1uF electrolytic capacitors (the PCB has 220uF on the sinkscreen)
- 1x 100uF electrolytic capacitor
- Either: 3x 3.5mm TRS PCB mount sockets
- Or: 1x 3.5mm TRS PCB mount sockets and 2x 180 DIN PCB mount sockets
- 1x 2.1mm barrel jack socket
- 2x 15-way pin header sockets
- 4x 40-way wide DIP sockets
- Pin headers
- Optional: 1x SPDT, 1x DPDT both with 2.54mm pitch connectors
- Optional: 1x 8-way DIP socket

Errata:
- As noted above the 220uF capacitors should be replaced with 1uF capacitors.
- Two of the 1K resistors have to be patched into the underside of the board.

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
