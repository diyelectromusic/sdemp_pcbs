# Arduino Atari 2600 Shield

This is a simple breakout board for Atari 2600 controllers for an Arudino Uno.

Note: The first version of this PCB support paddle controllers very well.  The revisited version has more complete support but the required code is more complex.

Bill of Materials:
- Arduino Atari PCB.
- 2x PCB-mount 9-way D-type controller sockets
- Set of arduino headers
- 4x 1K8 resistors (updated board only)
- 4x 68nF ceramic capacitors (updated board only).

Versions:
- Outputs - first version that has a very simplistic approach to supporting paddle controllers.
- Outputs2 - the revisited version that supports paddles more like the original Atari does, but requires much more complex code to function.

Errata:
- None

#  A Word of Caution!

Please note - I consider myself a novice at pcb design!

**Don't spend your own time and resources on any of these designs without knowing what you are doing.  They are not "off the shelf products" ready to go!**

Do not use this with expensive computer, audio, music or electronic equipment, it is for hobby use only.  For more details, see https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/pcbs/
